# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Cat&Dogs Classification

## Overview

In this project, we will explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Initially, we will develop and evaluate our own neural network for a classification task using TensorFlow data via the `tf.keras.datasets` API. Later, we will implement pre-trained models available in Keras. Finally, we will briefly compare the different models, focusing on metrics such as the confusion matrix and accuracy.

## Tasks Covered

- Building and training a custom CNN model.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models like VGG19 and InceptionResNetV2 for classification.
- Evaluation using performance metrics like confusion matrix and accuracy.

## Usage

To run the notebook, simply open the `cnn_cat_dogs_classification.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order. This notebook covers the entire workflow of CNN model development, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
